# Ticket-System
A personal project to develop skills in JS and launching a full packaged app. 

I dont have a streamlined process for this, and dont know where to start but ive just been going at it.

**The Systems are to be the following.**
   		 GUI:
			The GUI needs to be responsive to multiple device sizes including mobile. 
			  GUI should be clean and not distracting from the tools and software in place.
		 	  GUI remains "static" and the viewport within the application will be changing depoending on tool used.
		Data Storage: 
				Ticket form data will be stored in a JSON format since it is simple data to pull.
				Images and videos as attachments will be stored in a bulk storage media library. Each ticket gets their own folder to place media to reference later.
				All data will be handled server-side.
		Analytics Reporting:
				Reports different stats for tickets.
				[Rate of issues, amount per category, IP address capture, time sent/received]
				
		Security:
				I dont know how to secure my applications. 	
 
 		Tools:
	 			Two toolsets {Admin vs User}
		 		**Admin:**
		 					Create New Ticket
							Manage Tickets
			 				Ticket Inbox
							Chatbox
			 				Analytics
							Settings

		These tools are just to start, as its the core of the app. More will be added over time as the framework for the app is more finalized.

 Not for Commercial use by parties larger than 1 person. This is mean to be free for freelancers, and is to be paid if the business using my software is more than a single developer.
